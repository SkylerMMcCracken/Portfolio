The System has a user friendly UI with no guessing as to what each action will do. Use this to create new customers in the database, alter current information or remove current data.
The system should function similarly for appointment scheduling and modification as well as loading new reports. The additional report pulls all customer ID's without current appointments.

Main menu holds three buttons to the three sub menus. View Customers which loads the UT for all customers. From there you may add a new customer, modify or delete a customer by selecting one
in the table view and then clicking the appropriate button.

Within the add/modify customers screen there are separate fields for the necessary information. Fill them out appropriately and then click save, otherwise, click exit to return to the
customer view form. The exit button here returns to the main menu.

The next main section of the UT is the appointment view which contains a table view of all appointments. From here you can add a new appointment, modify or delete an appointment by
selecting one in the table view and then clicking the appropriate button.

Within the add/modify appointment screen there are separate fields and selections that need to be made to make an appointment. Fill them out appropriately and then click save,
otherwise click exit to return to the appointment view screen. You must hit enter after altering the time in the date-time picker for the time to be adjusted. Otherwise it will save based on
time when the date was selected.

Lastly the report section of system has three buttons that loads three different report. The first pulls all appointments then counts them by month and by type saved in the database.
The second opens a new UI with a combobox to allow the user to cycle between Contacts. The table view will filter all appointments with that contact.
The final report searches through all customer data and returns any that do not have a current appointment scheduled.
